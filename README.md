# TinyVideo & TinyBIMG

TinyVideo and TinyBIMG are libraries that make storing video and animated bimg files more easily. 

"Tiny" refers to both the short code that makes up the libraries and also the fact the libraries can seriously decrease file size of ComputerCraft blit video!

The libraries should be pretty self explanitory, they have 2 functions, encode and decode.
